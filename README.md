# Capstone Project

The capstone project for M.S. Data Science program included an opportunity to work with a client to identify a use case for data science and apply the appropriate skills and methodologies to help solve the problem.

Working with Pharmacy leaders, a need for a tool to help understand the demand fluctuations for the Specialty Pharmacy at Freodtert Health was determined. This was done through an evaluation of sales volume within the Specialty Pharmacy and used as an indicator for staffing levels.

(Proprietary) data was collected and heavy scrutiny was placed on variable selection and exploratory data analysis.

The data was reviewed and cleaned prior to being exported for analysis in R.

A series of regression models were applied to the data; Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net.

An optimal model was identified and many insights were derived to help the Pharmacy leaders understand their business in greater detail. Additionally, the results of the model were used in congruence with various other metrics to quantify the relationship between the variables and serve as a leading indicator of fulctuations in demand.
